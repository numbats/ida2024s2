2021/10/04 11:35:45 am GMT+11,Very informative and enjoyable
2021/10/04 11:36:04 am GMT+11,intrigued 
2021/10/04 11:37:38 am GMT+11,"Great for introduction for data analysis, but lots of works."
2021/10/04 11:37:41 am GMT+11,"satisfied, helpful"
2021/10/04 11:38:37 am GMT+11,"It's a great course (especially how the assignments are run), Thankyou!!"
2021/10/04 11:38:51 am GMT+11,R has so many commands! It looks easy but a bit more confusing than Python in this sense.
2021/10/04 11:39:29 am GMT+11,Very interesting and practical!
2021/10/04 11:40:19 am GMT+11,it is a bit difficult but also helpful 
2021/10/04 11:40:22 am GMT+11,"The course is satisfying, though it can be tedious at times, due to the process of coding."
2021/10/04 11:49:21 am GMT+11,First half was very interesting. Since then all the assessment has been a bit rushed and overwhelming. 
2021/10/04 1:32:40 pm GMT+11,"I've definitely enjoyed that the project was open to what the group wanted to study. However, I feel like smashing the class with 80% of the important content in the first 3 weeks made it challenging, and I've felt like I've been playing catchup since."
2021/10/04 3:38:07 pm GMT+11,"This course covers a wide range of topics. Very intense, but very interesting and has real world application. I enjoyed it even though keeping up with it is a struggle. "
2021/10/05 1:21:31 am GMT+11,Fairly interesting and fun
2021/10/05 5:59:57 am GMT+11,comlicated. still need much more time before being tested. Too many professional words to memorize.
2021/10/05 11:04:32 am GMT+11,I love the content and the exercises but by the group assignments makes doing this unit unbearable.
2021/10/05 2:03:07 pm GMT+11,Seems useful and well taught 
2021/10/05 5:50:09 pm GMT+11,useful course in comparison with others
2021/10/05 11:34:06 pm GMT+11,It is an amazing course! I got to learn a lot!
2021/10/05 11:44:27 pm GMT+11,"Very broad, interesting, practical however I feel like the date and times of assessments could be made clearer, particularly for the group project"
2021/10/05 11:46:07 pm GMT+11,"You're an amazing teacher Joan, thanks!"
2021/10/06 10:02:54 am GMT+11,I love this course!
2021/10/06 2:09:18 pm GMT+11,I enjoy it because it is different and interesting but sometimes it can be challenging and stressful.
2021/10/06 2:50:17 pm GMT+11,It is an intensive and challenging course but with so much fun! 
2021/10/06 3:29:46 pm GMT+11,this course is very helpful for data science major and also quite comprehensible
2021/10/06 5:38:12 pm GMT+11,"Coding is a bit challenging, but quite useful! I enjoy the unit!"
2021/10/06 8:47:34 pm GMT+11,"Intrigued and overall I am happy, but frustrated with assignment explanations!"
2021/10/06 10:58:50 pm GMT+11,Stressed

2021/10/07 5:03:32 pm GMT+11,I feel challenge and happy but it is too difficult for an art student to study this...
2021/10/07 7:11:40 pm GMT+11,Very interesting but kind of hard for me

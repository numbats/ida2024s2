## Final Assessment Format

The final assessment will be an [e-assessment](https://www.monash.edu/students/admin/assessments/exams) on campus. 

::: {.callout-warning}

## Rules

- All answers should be written as sentences. Please do not use bullet points (even though some of the practice exam solutions have bullet points)
- **No calculators! They are not needed.**
- No cheat sheet (We will confirm this later this week).
- You don't need to write any code.
- You get up to 5 blank pieces of working paper

:::

::: {.callout-important}

## Topics

- All topics from week 1 to week 11 are covered.
- Except for those we identified as non-examinable during the lectures, such as regular expressions.
- Focus on the methodology and the interpretation rather than the implementation in R.

:::

---

## Final Assessment Format

::: {.callout-note}

## Format


- There are 60 marks for undergrad students - so 2 min per mark on average
- Post-grad students (ETC5510) have an extra 5 mark question
  + *Why?* It is a requirement of the University's accreditation for assessments > 20%
- The format is the same as the practice exam
- Questions will appear like a quiz
- There are some T/F MCQ questions
- Most are short answer

:::

---

## Final Assessment Format

::: {.callout-note}

## Expectation for answers

- Generally 1-3 mark questions just need a short sentence or two in answer to a specific question
- Some questions worth > 3 marks may involve a list, so short sentences ar OK here too
- Questions that ask you to discuss or justify your answer
  + These require a bit more thought
  + They also are open, so any sensible discussion is OK
  + You need to be able to explain your reasoning
- Hopefully you realise that the formatting and expectations are similar to A2
- Remember this when you do the practice exam

:::

---

## Final Assessment Advice

+ Read the questions carefully in reading time
+ Identify the questions that you think you know and do those first
+ This should leave time to think about the other questions
+ If you get stuck - move on and return.
+ Worst case - just write something and you may be lucky
+ Blank answers get 0, but an attempt may not!

## Exam Consultations

- Use this, especially to check you practice exam answers
- Check the timetable on Moodle (will release soon)

## Course Recap {.transition-slide .center style="text-align: center;"}

## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

- We explored the **EDA process** in detail.
- The entire unit focuses on EDA.
- It's important to understand the **goals and aims** of EDA.
- Be aware of what EDA can and cannot accomplish.
- Use your lecture notes as a guide to help you **explain the EDA process in your own words**!
---

## EDA: Tidy Data

- **What is tidy data?**
- **Why is tidy data important?**
- What **functions** can you use to transform your data into a tidy format?

---

## EDA: Reproducible Analysis

- You have been using **Quarto/RMarkdown** for some time.
- **Why is reproducible analysis important?**
- What should we be cautious about when using Quarto/RMarkdown for reproducible practices?

---

## EDA: Visualization

- Consider the various types of visualizations and their corresponding functions.
- What are the best practices and common pitfalls in visualization? How do we evaluate the quality of a visualization?
- **What questions can specific graphs help answer?**
- Focus on the **interpretation** of the information presented by the statistical graphics.
---

## Relational Data

- **What is relational data?**
- **What are the different types of keys?**
- **What are the different types of joins, and how do they differ from one another?**


---

## Web Scraping

- This topic is **non-examinable**.
- How do we locate the desired node on a webpage?
- How can we extract text using regular expressions?
- What methods can we use to automatically scrape multiple pages?

---

## Text Analysis

- **Regular expressions and metacharacters** (**non-examinable**)
- What is the **tidy text format**?
- What is a **text token**?
- What units of text are typically used as tokens?
- What are **stop words**?
- What is **sentiment analysis**?
- How do we evaluate word importance? What statistics can we use, and what do they measure?

---

## Cluster Analysis

- What is **cluster analysis**, and how does it relate to EDA?
- What are the limitations of **cluster analysis**?
- What is **hierarchical clustering**, and what are the two types of hierarchical clustering? How do they differ?
- What are the common **distance measures** used in clustering?
- What are the common **linkage methods** for hierarchical clustering?

---

## Cluster Analysis
  
- Describe in your own words how **k-means** and **hierarchical clustering** work. What are the steps involved in conducting each method?
- How do we determine the number of clusters for k-means and hierarchical clustering? How do we interpret a dendrogram?
- Understand the **advantages** and **disadvantages** of k-means and hierarchical clustering:
  - K-means is generally faster.
  - The agglomerative approach is generally faster than the divisive approach.
  - K-means involves randomness, while hierarchical clustering does not.
  - ...
- How to visualize clustering result in high-dimensional data space? What should be checked?

- What is a **linear model**?
- Why do we include an **error term** in the formula?
- What are the **model assumptions**, and what are the assumptions regarding the error term?
- **How do we interpret the estimated coefficients and predicted/fitted values?** (This is extremely important for the correct interpretation of the model.)
- Why do we use the term "average" frequently in our interpretations?


---

## Modeling

- What plots should be created to check **model assumptions**?
- What constitutes a good **residual plot**, and what should we check for?
  - Patterns
  - Variance
  - Normality
  - ...
- What statistics can be used and should be consistently checked to assess the quality of the fit?
- How do we handle **categorical variables**, and how do we interpret coefficients for those variables?
- How do we perform **model selection**?

---

## R Code

- While R code isn't required for the exam, it's important to know how to use it.
- **You do need to know which package we heavily rely on for each topic for the exam! (e.g. `tidytext` for text analysis and `broom` for linear modeling)**
- Master `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, these two will be your most used packages in data analysis.
- You may encounter a small code example where you'll need to explain its functionality (similar to the practice exam).
- Remember to **practice, practice, and practice**!

---

## Finally

- Double check your grades and let us know of any issues **BEFORE** the end of Swot Vac.
- Check A2 immediately and let us know of any issues **BEFORE** the exam if possible.
- If not, straight after the exam - marks will be finalised a week after the exam

- The weekly quiz grades are 0 or 1, best 10/11. So the actual grade doesn't count - you just had to attempt it!

- Well done on making it through the semester
- Good luck on the exam!
